In this work I learned the most important git commands like:
1.git clone to clone the remote repository.
2.git add to add the file to the repository.
3.git branch to create a new branch.
4.git merge to merge some branch into the current branch.
5.git log to view the change history.

In my opinion, DevOps works out and automates the process of building and delivering code from a developer to production.
