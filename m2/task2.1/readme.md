Part 1. HYPERVISORS
1. Most often used hypervisors VMware and Hyper-V.
2.
  * The most expensive solution today is VMware, Hyper-V is cheaper.

  * The VMware solution implements a fault tolerance mechanism, while Hyper-V does not yet.

  * VMware has a better VDI implementation, but Hyper-V is cheaper to set up VDI.

  * The Hyper-V solution is less demanding on the hardware side.

  * In the case of using Hyper-V, the organization of storage will cost less than VMware.

  * VMware has dedicated tools for balancing loads across host resources; Hyper-V does not.

  * With System Center Virtual Machine Manager in Hyper-V, it is possible not only to implement simple server virtualization projects, but also to create private clouds.
